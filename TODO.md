## ToDo - Survey
* **Unique IDs for 3D primitives**  Check IDs in generated source code the ID is enumerated from 1 to N instead of using a unique timestamp for all primitives in the JSON. unique timestamps are necessary to distinguish primitives of the same type (e.g. spheres, cubes, ...)
* **CSS Classes and CSS IDs** Some objects like the pyramid are constructed from primitives e.g. triangles. The triangles need a unique ID and aggregated 3D objects get the JSON ID as a CSS class name that identifies a unique object in the JSON. All triangles that compose the pyramid get in addition to unique ID also the JSON ID as class name. The JSON ID is a unique key in JSON. `getElementsByClass('myJSONid')` allows to collect all Aframe DOM elements that belong to JSON3D4Aframe 3D object and change jointly the color of those primitives.
